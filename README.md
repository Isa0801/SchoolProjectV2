# SchoolProject V2

## Main Branch

This is a repository for a group project we're making in school. 
This is our [Trello](https://trello.com/b/XL7BJNWe/school-project-v2) board for managment. 



We will use multiple branches as well. *Isa* will have his own, and I will have my own, *Sebastian*. 
We are going to be organizing our job so that it does not conflict while using a branch each(if possible). 
Later on we will push to the *main* branch once we have a major version which would be stable.

At the moment whilst we are still researching on a couple of ideas, we have not yet decided what our main project idea will be about.
